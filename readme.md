## Development environment setup

You will need NodeJS v8 to be able to run this project. Prepare:

``` bash
git clone <proj>
cd <proj>
npm install
```

Now run the following depending on what you need:

+ `npm run client-dev`: run client development configuration with hot reload. You will need to run server separately, see below.
+ `npm run build-and-start`: run full production build and start the server.
+ `npm run server-build-and-start`: build and run server only.
